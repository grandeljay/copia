No synchronization<br \/><br \/> Your online shop&apos;s inventory will not be synchronized with Etsy.<br \/><br \/> 2. Automatic synchronization with zero stock (recommended)<br \/><br \/> Your online shop&apos;s inventory is automatically synchronized with Etsy. Products with < 1 item in stock will be inactivated, but automatically reactivated as soon as inventory increases to > 0.<br \/><br \/> Important note: Etsy charges fees when reactivating items.<br \/><br \/> 3. Automatic synchronization without zero stock<br \/><br \/> Your inventory will only be synchronized automatically if stock is > 0. Items on Etsy will not automatically be reactivated - even when you have them in stock in your online shop. This prevents non-transparent fees.<br \/><br \/> General Hints:<br \/><ul> <li>Automatic inventory synchronization takes place every 4 hours via CronJob. The cycle starts daily at midnight.<\/li> <li>Item variants: Automatic inventory synchronization of item variants (even if stock is <1) is free of charge on Etsy, as long as one variant of the product stock > 0.<\/li> <li>You can reactivate single inactive products by setting your online shop&apos;s inventory to > 0 and initiate your product upload via the magnalister plugin again.<\/li> <li>The automatic inventory synchronization takes place every 4 hours via CronJob. The cycle starts daily at 0:00 am. The values from the database are checked and transferred, even if the changes were only made in the database by - for example - stock management applications.<\/li> <li>In addition, in our \"Flat\" plan, you can trigger the stock synchronization with your own CronJob in an interval of no more than 15 minutes by calling the following link of your webshop:<\/li> http:\/\/www.YourShop.com\/magnaCallback.php?do=SyncInventory<\/li> <li>CronJobs calls from customers, who are not in the \"Flat\" plan or who run the calls more frequently than every 15 minutes, are blocked.<\/li> <li>You can manually trigger a synchronization by clicking on the corresponding button in the top right-hand corner of the header.<\/li> <\/ul> Find more information about Etsy&apos;s fees via <a href=\"https:\/\/help.etsy.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360000344908\" target=\"_blank\">Etsy Help Center<\/a>.",
